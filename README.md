# The 4 hour guide to Git and GitHub

A set of slides that anyone can use to organize a 4 hour Git/GitHub training session.

## Motivation

Git is an awesome tool and I have not met a developer who went through the learning curve and regreted it. Combined with GitHub (or a similar service), it is even more helpful and everyone should learn how to use it.

I think in most developer groups (user-groups, companies, schools, etc) there is at least one developer who has some experience with Git. Taking the time to show to his/her fellows how to jump into Git is often the best way to get them started but most do not have the time to prepare a full training.

With those slides, available under the Creative Commons license, I hope that many developers will take the time to organize a small training for their friends and colleagues so that everyone joins the fun!

## Teaching approach

 * Pragmatic - Even a little simplistic
 * No inner git explaination (tree/blob/commit objects)
 * Only the basic commands

## How to use

 * Get a 4 hour timeframe with a bunch of developers
 * Fork the slides
 * (Optional) Adapt them to your company/context/audience
 * Do the presentation
 * Let me know how it went!
